## **Description of Exercisea System**
> Exercisea System is a web application used for tracking exercises and their categories. The application allows users to view available categories and add exercises with descriptions, photos or videos under each category. Users can also add comments to exercises, which can be visible to all application users.

### **User Roles**
**The application will have two user roles:**

#### **Administrator**

#### **Registered User**

* Technologies Used in the Project


### **The development of the application will use a combination of technologies:**

* React.js: A library for building user interfaces. I do not have much experience with this technology yet, but I am learning to work with it in the PB138 course.
* Next.js + Prisma: Provides server-side rendering and serves as an ORM (object-relational mapping) layer for working with the database. I am learning to work with both technologies in the PB138 and PV178 courses.
* SQLite: A relational database for storing data - I have worked with this technology in the PV178 course.
* Bootstrap: An open-source CSS framework for developing websites that I have not yet worked with, but my team partner has experience with.

> Front-end: React.js

> Back-end: Next.js + Prisma

> Database: SQLite

> CSS Framework: Tailwindcss

### **Lifecycle Model**
For this project, we have decided to use the Agile lifecycle model. This model allows for flexibility and rapid iteration, which is important for developing a web application. With this model, it is possible to adapt to changes in requirements during development and gradually add new features to the application. It also allows the customer to monitor the development progress and provide feedback.
